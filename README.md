# HSRL
Official implementation of the paper ‚ÄúHierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Spaces for RL-based Recommendation‚Äù.


This repository provides code, processing scripts for HSRL ‚Äî a novel reinforcement learning framework for recommender systems. HSRL introduces Semantic Action Space (SAS), which maps item-level actions to compact, hierarchical semantic identifiers (SIDs). With a Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) and a Multi-level Critic (MLC), HSRL stabilizes training, improves interpretability, and scales RL to large-scale recommendation scenarios.

üîπ Key Features:

Implementation of HSRL framework with SAS, HPN, and MLC

Scripts for training, evaluation, and reproduction of results
